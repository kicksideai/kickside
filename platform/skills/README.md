# kickside/skills

Versioned reusable agent procedures and skill capabilities.

This module installs independently into a [KickSide](https://kickside.ai) host.

## Quick start

In **System → Modules**, select the package from the Wippy Hub and review its
requirements. For CLI dependency setup, run from the host application directory:

```sh
wippy add kickside/skills
wippy install
```

Apply host bindings and migrations through the application install plan.
Review the manifest and registry requirements before enabling the module.
Host resources and security groups bind through the install plan.

## Key concepts

Registry declarations define the public entries, dependencies, and host requirements.
See the [registry and API reference](src/README.md) for the module contract.

## Requirements

Wippy 0.3.x; repository validation uses 0.3.47a. Use current Hub dependencies
for the contracts declared by the module.
The standalone harness uses SQLite and declares a PostgreSQL test profile.
Frontend development also uses Node.js 22, npm, and Make.

## Development

From this module directory:

```sh
cd test
wippy install
cd ..
make lint
make test
cd test
wippy test --profile postgres --set vars.pg_database=kickside_readme_test
```

Create a dedicated PostgreSQL database before the profile run and drop it
afterward. Set the `pg_host`, `pg_port`, `pg_username`, and `pg_password`
variables in the harness configuration for your test server.
Edit frontend source under `ui/` and run `make -C ../../ build MOD=skills` from this directory;
commit regenerated tracked assets with the source.
